            <p class="article-dek">
                Through conversations with residents across Metro Vancouver, we explore how skyrocketing rental prices 
                are reshaping the economic reality for students, workers, and families. From tent cities in the Downtown 
                Eastside to overcrowded apartments in Burnaby, the human cost of Canada's housing market tells a story 
                the statistics alone cannot capture.

            <p>
                Maria Santos wakes up at 5:30 AM every morning in a basement suite she shares with three other people. 
                The rent is $1,800 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in East Vancouver, which means she pays $450 to sleep 
                on a pullout couch in the living room. She works two jobs as a barista and a retail clerk, pulling in roughly 
                $2,800 a month after taxes. After rent, transit, and groceries, she has less than $400 left for everything else.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I came to Vancouver for school three years ago," Maria tells us over coffee at a Commercial Drive cafe where 
                she works. "I thought I'd graduate, get a job, maybe rent my own place. Now I'm just trying to survive. Every 
                month I wonder if I should just leave."
            </p>

            <p>
                Maria's story is not unique. Across Metro Vancouver, we spoke with dozens of residents struggling with the 
                economic reality of one of the world's most expensive housing markets. While economists and policymakers debate 
                interest rates, zoning laws, and supply constraints, real people are making impossible calculations about their futures.
            </p>

            <h2>The Numbers Behind the Crisis</h2>

            <p>
                The statistics are stark. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the average rent for a 
                one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver reached $2,400 in late 2025, up nearly 30% from three years earlier. 
                For a two-bedroom, that figure climbs to $3,200. Meanwhile, the median income for renters has increased by 
                just 12% over the same period.
            </p>

            <p>
                These numbers translate into a simple reality: housing costs are outpacing incomes at an unprecedented rate. 
                For someone earning Vancouver's median renter income of approximately $48,000 annually, a one-bedroom apartment 
                now consumes 60% of pre-tax income, well above the 30% threshold that economists consider affordable.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "We're seeing people make choices we've never seen before. Professionals in their thirties living with roommates. 
                Families choosing between rent and food. This isn't just an inconvenience anymore, it's an economic emergency."
                <footer>— Dr. Jennifer Park, Urban Economics Professor at UBC</footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                But statistics alone cannot capture the human dimension of the crisis. To understand that, you have to talk to people.
            </p>

            <h2>Voices from the Ground</h2>

            <p>
                James Chen, 28, is a software developer who moved to Vancouver from Toronto two years ago for a job at a tech 
                startup. He earns $95,000 a year, well above the city's median income. Yet he still lives with two roommates in 
                a three-bedroom apartment in Mount Pleasant, paying $1,500 for his room.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I could afford to live alone," James explains. "But then I'd be spending over half my income on rent. I'm trying 
                to save for a down payment, but every year prices go up faster than I can save. I make six figures and I still 
                can't afford to live here long-term. What does that say about everyone else?"
            </p>

            <p>
                We meet Sarah Kim, a nurse at Vancouver General Hospital, in the parking lot of her apartment building in New 
                Westminster. She commutes an hour each way to work because she cannot afford to live closer to the hospital. 
                Her one-bedroom apartment costs $1,900 a month.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I'm a healthcare worker," she says, frustration evident in her voice. "I'm supposed to be middle class. But I 
                can barely afford to live within an hour of my job. My friends who are teachers, social workers, they're all in 
                the same boat. We're the people who keep this city running, and we're being pushed out."
            </p>

            <h2>The Ripple Effects</h2>

            <p>
                The housing crisis is not just about where people sleep. It is reshaping the entire economic fabric of the region. 
                Small businesses report difficulty attracting workers who cannot afford to live nearby. Students are delaying or 
                abandoning graduate studies because they cannot afford both tuition and rent. Young professionals are leaving for 
                other cities, taking their skills and tax contributions with them.
            </p>

            <p>
                David Martinez runs a small restaurant in Kitsilano. He has five open positions he cannot fill, despite offering 
                wages above minimum. "People can't afford to work here," he explains. "They'd spend their entire paycheck on rent. 
                I've had applicants turn down jobs because the commute would be two hours each way. How is that sustainable?"
            </p>

            <p>
                The crisis is also creating new forms of housing insecurity. We spoke with Lisa Wong, who works as a graphic 
                designer while studying part-time at Emily Carr University. She sublets a room month-to-month because she cannot 
                afford to sign a year-long lease. This precarity affects every aspect of her life.
            </p>

            <p>
                "I can't plan anything," Lisa tells us. "I don't know if I'll be able to afford to stay in two months. I can't 
                commit to a job that requires me to be in the office. I can't get a pet. I can't really build a life here because 
                I don't know if I'll still be here next year."
            </p>

            <h2>Looking for Solutions</h2>

            <p>
                Economists point to multiple factors driving the crisis: decades of underbuilding, restrictive zoning laws, low 
                interest rates fueling speculation, and Vancouver's position as a global destination for investment and immigration. 
                Solutions are complex and contested, ranging from increased density and housing supply to rent controls and foreign 
                buyer restrictions.
            </p>

            <p>
                But for the people we spoke with, these policy debates feel distant from their daily reality. They are not 
                waiting for comprehensive solutions. They are making hard choices right now about whether they can afford to 
                stay in the city they call home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Maria, the barista we met at the beginning of this story, has made her decision. When we follow up with her two 
                weeks after our initial conversation, she tells us she is moving back to Ontario in March. "I love Vancouver," 
                she says. "But love doesn't pay the rent. I can't keep living like this."
            </p>

            <p>
                Her story is not unique. It is the story of thousands of people across Metro Vancouver, making the same calculation, 
                coming to the same conclusion. The housing crisis is not just about affordability metrics or policy frameworks. It 
                is about people, their dreams, and their futures. And right now, those futures are increasingly being built somewhere else.
