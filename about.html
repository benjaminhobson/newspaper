            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The Pulse UBC was founded on a simple belief: the best economic journalism happens when you talk to real people, not just experts and policymakers. 
                While traditional economics coverage focuses on policy papers and market data, we believe the most important stories are found in conversations 
                with the people experiencing economic change firsthand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every week, we publish in-depth reporting that combines rigorous economic analysis with ground-level journalism. We interview workers, business owners, 
                students, and community members to understand how policies, market forces, and economic trends shape daily life in Vancouver and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                From wealth inequality to monetary policy, from housing affordability to labor markets, we explore the economics that matters, told through 
                the voices of those who live it.

                <h3 class="writer-name">Sarah Chen</h3>
                <p class="writer-bio">
                    Sarah is a third-year Economics student at UBC originally from San Francisco. Her reporting focuses on wealth inequality, 
                    housing policy, and the intersection of economics and social justice. Before co-founding The Pulse, she covered student 
                    housing issues for The Ubyssey and interned at the San Francisco Federal Reserve.

                <p class="writer-bio">
                    Michael is a fourth-year student studying Economics and Political Science at UBC. His work explores labor markets, 
                    monetary policy, and the gig economy. He's particularly interested in how macroeconomic policy affects workers and 
                    small businesses. When he's not reporting, he's analyzing central bank communications and market trends.
